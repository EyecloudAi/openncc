Comment: Regarding the NetCDF code included in HDF4.
 NOTE:
 .
 Even if the original NetCDF copyright in 1993 was more restrictive, as it results
 in the COPYRIGHT document enclosed in the 'mfhdf' directory, the NetCDF group
 kindly agreed in July 2008 to re-release the old stuff embedded in the
 HDF4 sources in the same terms currently used for the modern NetCDF library,
 after 1996 which is the license enclosed above.
 See the netcdf-copyright-statement file added to the Debian material
 for a statement about that by the HDF4 team head. HDF4 will acknowledge the change
 in a successive release, and this note will become supefluous at that time.
