Comment:
 This module uses the word stemming code developed by the Snowball project,
 http://snowballstem.org which is released by them under a BSD-style license.
 Postgres' files under src/backend/snowball/libstemmer/ and
 src/include/snowball/libstemmer/ are taken directly from the Snowball files,
 with only some minor adjustments of file inclusions.
 See src/backend/snowball/README for details.
