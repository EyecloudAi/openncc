Comment: Thanks to Rodney Brown <rbrown64@csc.com.au> for his contribution of faster
 CRC methods: exclusive-oring 32 bits of data at a time, and pre-computing
 tables for updating the shift register in one step with three exclusive-ors
 instead of four steps with four exclusive-ors.  This results in about a
 factor of two increase in speed on a Power PC G4 (PPC7455) using gcc -O3.

 This code implements the MD5 message-digest algorithm.
 The algorithm is due to Ron Rivest.  This code was
 written by Colin Plumb in 1993, no copyright is claimed.
 This code is in the public domain; do with it what you wish.
 .
 Equivalent code is available from RSA Data Security, Inc.
 This code has been tested against that, and is equivalent,
 except that you don't need to include two pages of legalese
 with every copy.
 .
 To compute the message digest of a chunk of bytes, declare an
 MD5Context structure, pass it to MD5Init, call MD5Update as
 needed on buffers full of bytes, and then call MD5Final, which
 will fill a supplied 16-byte array with the digest.
 .
 This code was modified in 1997 by Jim Kingdon of Cyclic Software to
 not require an integer type which is exactly 32 bits.  This work
 draws on the changes for the same purpose by Tatu Ylonen
 <ylo@cs.hut.fi> as part of SSH, but since I didn't actually use
 that code, there is no copyright issue.  I hereby disclaim
 copyright in any changes I have made; this code remains in the
 public domain.

 LEGAL ISSUES
 ============
 .
 In plain English:
 .
 1. We don't promise that this software works.  (But if you find any bugs,
    please let us know!)
 2. You can use this software for whatever you want.  You don't have to pay us.
 3. You may not pretend that you wrote this software.  If you use it in a
    program, you must acknowledge somewhere in your documentation that
    you've used the IJG code.
 .
 In legalese:
 .
 The authors make NO WARRANTY or representation, either express or implied,
 with respect to this software, its quality, accuracy, merchantability, or
 fitness for a particular purpose.  This software is provided "AS IS", and you,
 its user, assume the entire risk as to its quality and accuracy.
 .
 This software is copyright (C) 1991-1998, Thomas G. Lane.
 All Rights Reserved except as specified below.
 .
 Permission is hereby granted to use, copy, modify, and distribute this
 software (or portions thereof) for any purpose, without fee, subject to these
 conditions:
 (1) If any part of the source code for this software is distributed, then this
 README file must be included, with this copyright and no-warranty notice
 unaltered; and any additions, deletions, or changes to the original files
 must be clearly indicated in accompanying documentation.
 (2) If only executable code is distributed, then the accompanying
 documentation must state that "this software is based in part on the work of
 the Independent JPEG Group".
 (3) Permission for use of this software is granted only if the user accepts
 full responsibility for any undesirable consequences; the authors accept
 NO LIABILITY for damages of any kind.
 .
 These conditions apply to any software derived from or based on the IJG code,
 not just to the unmodified library.  If you use our work, you ought to
 acknowledge us.
 .
 Permission is NOT granted for the use of any IJG author's name or company name
 in advertising or publicity relating to this software or products derived from
 it.  This software may be referred to only as "the Independent JPEG Group's
 software".
 .
 We specifically permit and encourage the use of this software as the basis of
 commercial products, provided that all warranty or liability claims are
 assumed by the product vendor.
 .
 .
 ansi2knr.c is included in this distribution by permission of L. Peter Deutsch,
 sole proprietor of its copyright holder, Aladdin Enterprises of Menlo Park, CA.
 ansi2knr.c is NOT covered by the above copyright and conditions, but instead
 by the usual distribution terms of the Free Software Foundation; principally,
 that you must include source code if you redistribute it.  (See the file
 ansi2knr.c for full details.)  However, since ansi2knr.c is not needed as part
 of any program generated from the IJG code, this does not limit you more than
 the foregoing paragraphs do.
 .
 The Unix configuration script "configure" was produced with GNU Autoconf.
 It is copyright by the Free Software Foundation but is freely distributable.
 The same holds for its supporting scripts (config.guess, config.sub,
 ltconfig, ltmain.sh).  Another support script, install-sh, is copyright
 by M.I.T. but is also freely distributable.
 .
 It appears that the arithmetic coding option of the JPEG spec is covered by
 patents owned by IBM, AT&T, and Mitsubishi.  Hence arithmetic coding cannot
 legally be used without obtaining one or more licenses.  For this reason,
 support for arithmetic coding has been removed from the free JPEG software.
 (Since arithmetic coding provides only a marginal gain over the unpatented
 Huffman mode, it is unlikely that very many implementations will support it.)
 So far as we are aware, there are no patent restrictions on the remaining
 code.
 .
 The IJG distribution formerly included code to read and write GIF files.
 To avoid entanglement with the Unisys LZW patent, GIF reading support has
 been removed altogether, and the GIF writer has been simplified to produce
 "uncompressed GIFs".  This technique does not use the LZW algorithm; the
 resulting GIF files are larger than usual, but are readable by all standard
 GIF decoders.
 .
 We are required to state that
     "The Graphics Interchange Format(c) is the Copyright property of
     CompuServe Incorporated.  GIF(sm) is a Service Mark property of
     CompuServe Incorporated."

        versions are further prohibited from misrepresentative use of the
