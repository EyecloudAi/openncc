 1. License Terms.

      grants Licensee a non-sublicensable, perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive,
      no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as expressly stated in this
      License) patent license to its Necessary Claims to make, use, sell, offer
      for sale, import or distribute any Implementation.
 .
 1.2. Conditions.
 .
 1.2.1. Availability. As a condition to the grant of rights to Licensee to make,
        sell, offer for sale, import or distribute an Implementation under
        Section 1.1, Licensee must make its Necessary Claims available under
        this License, and must reproduce this License with any Implementation
        as follows:
 .
        a. For distribution in source code, by including this License in the
           root directory of the source code with its Implementation.
 .

 1.3. Defensive Termination. If any Licensee, its Affiliates, or its agents

      participates in a lawsuit against another entity or any person asserting
      that any Implementation infringes Necessary Claims, any patent licenses
      granted under this License directly to the Licensee are immediately
      terminated as of the date of the initiation of action unless 1) that suit
      was in response to a corresponding suit regarding an Implementation first
      brought against an initiating entity, or 2) that suit was brought to
      enforce the terms of this License (including intervention in a third-party
      action by a Licensee).
 .
 1.4. Disclaimers. The Reference Implementation and Specification are provided
      "AS IS" and without warranty. The entire risk as to implementing or
      otherwise using the Reference Implementation or Specification is assumed
      by the implementer and user. Licensor expressly disclaims any warranties
      (express, implied, or otherwise), including implied warranties of
      merchantability, non-infringement, fitness for a particular purpose, or
      title, related to the material. IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO
      ANY OTHER PARTY FOR LOST PROFITS OR ANY FORM OF INDIRECT, SPECIAL,
      INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER FROM ANY CAUSES OF
      ACTION OF ANY KIND WITH RESPECT TO THIS LICENSE, WHETHER BASED ON BREACH
