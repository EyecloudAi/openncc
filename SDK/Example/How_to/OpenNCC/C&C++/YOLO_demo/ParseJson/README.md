# Background

This demo is used to demonstrate how to run the Yolo model using openncc. The Yolo V4 tiny model is currently used in the demo. If you want to run Yolo V3 or V5, you only need to make a few changes to the code. . Demo has been tested on Ubuntu(usb 3.0) .

# Install

This demo uses libusb,ffmpeg and opencv.Go check them out if you don't have them locally installed.
For the opencv version, you must ensure that the opencv you use contains the function "dnn::NMSBoxes". It is recommended to use opencv3.4.12. 

```shell
$ sudo apt-get install libusb-dev  libusb-1.0-0-dev
$ sudo apt-get install ffmpeg

```install opencv3.4.12
$ sudo apt-get install cmake
$ sudo apt-get install build-essential libgtk2.0-dev libavcodec-dev libavformat-dev libjpeg.dev libtiff4.dev libswscale-dev libjasper-dev
$ git clone https://github.com/opencv/opencv.git
$ cd opencv
$ git checkout 3.4.12
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local ..
$ sudo make
$ sudo make install	
```

Note:if you want to copy the command to the command line,remember to remove `$`.
