When you run the program, a U-disk will appear, and then according to the Tips.txt put `OpenNCC_app_uvc.mvcmd`  or `OpenNCC_app_vsc.mvcmd`(in `bin/Firmware`) into U-disk. 

`OpenNCC_app_uvc.mvcmd` for UVC folder.

`OpenNCC_app_vsc.mvcmd` for VSC folder.

Wait for the U-disk to disappear and use the command `lsusb` to view it. If `f63b`  (for UVC)or ` f63d`(for VSC) appears, it means success.
