# Premise

If you want to execute this demo, you must first execute update_app.

# Install

This demo uses libusb,ffmpeg ,opencv and libv4l.Go check them out if you don't have them locally installed.

```shell
$ sudo apt-get install libusb-dev  libusb-1.0-0-dev
$ sudo apt-get install ffmpeg
$ sudo apt-get install libopencv-dev
$ sudo apt-get install libv4l-dev
```

Note:if you want to copy the command to the command line,remember to remove `$`.

Note:if you are opencv4,please modify Makefile
```shell
OPENCV   = `pkg-config opencv4 --cflags --libs`
INCS     =  -I./inc
COMMFLAG =  -DUSE_WD -D__PC__ $(OPENCV)
```
# Usage

Plug in the device.

1. If you want to learn available targets.

```makefile
$ make help
```

2. To clone or update the required libraries.

```makefile
$ make clone
```

3. To clone libraries and build the project.

```makefile
$ make all
```

4. To build and run the project.

```makefile
$ make run
```

5. To clean the object (.o) and executable files generated by make.

```makefile
$ make clean
```

Because opencv installed is 4.1.1, so you need to change the content in your Makefile.

Change 
```shell
OPENCV = `pkg-config opencv --cflags --libs`
```
to 
```shell
OPENCV = `pkg-config opencv4 --cflags --libs`
```

add `$(OPENCV)` after `COMMFLAG = -DUSE_WD`
like `COMMFLAG = -DUSE_WD $(OPENCV)`

then

```makefile
$ make run
```

When you run the program, a U-disk will appear, and then according to the Tips.txt put `M1_model.blob` , `M2_model_2.blob  `,and `OpenNCC_config.json` (in `Model/Plate`) into U-disk. 

**If you want to update yours model, please rename your model to** `M1*.blob` ,`M2*.blob` .

Wait for the U-disk to disappear and use the command `lsusb` to view it. If `f63b` appears, it means success.

```shell
beam@beam:~$ lsusb
Bus 004 Device 004: ID 03e7:f63b  
```

#  Demo function 

Update two blob.
