Because opencv installed is 4.1.1, so you need to change the content in your Makefile.

Change 
```shell
OPENCV = `pkg-config opencv --cflags --libs`
```
to 
```shell
OPENCV = `pkg-config opencv4 --cflags --libs`
```

add `$(OPENCV)` after `COMMFLAG = -DUSE_WD`
like `COMMFLAG = -DUSE_WD $(OPENCV)`

then

```makefile
$ make run
```
